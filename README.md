# Objectives
After finishing Deep Learning course at Harvard Extension School in May 2019, I would like to challenge my skills or the knowledge I gained from the course so I decided to build this Robotic car.

The objective of this challenge is to: Build a Convolution Neural Network model from scratch which identifies the lane direction (forward, left and right) and deploy the model onto Raspberry PI board which drives the Robotic car.
